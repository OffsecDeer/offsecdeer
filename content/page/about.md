## Who am I?
I'm Giulio, junior penetration tester and cyber security consultant. I'm just a guy who loves experimenting with offensive security and other computer-related subjects like ROM hacking, vintage computers and VoIP.
This blog is mostly about hacking and pentesting, in particular I love researching Windows and Active Directory security, but other subjects might pop up too.
