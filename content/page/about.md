## Who am I?
I'm Giulio, junior penetration tester. I'm just a guy who loves experimenting with offensive security and other computer-related subjects like ROM hacking, vintage computers, VoIP, and network pentesting in general.
This blog is mostly about hacking and offensive security, in particular I love researching Windows and Active Directory but other subjects might pop up too.
