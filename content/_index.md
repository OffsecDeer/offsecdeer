Hello and welcome to my blog.

Take your time to sift through my [posts](/post/) to see if any one picks your interest, I mainly talk about offensive cybersecurity] but you might find bits and pieces of programming, ROM hacking, and capture the flag (CTF) challenges and maybe even more generic topics I find interesting.

If you're interested in the theme I use for the site you can find it [here](https://github.com/OffsecDeer/Deer).

If you want to have a discussion on any topic, feel like exchanging ideas, or want to ask me any questions there are a few ways you can reach me, the comments on this website being one of them, otherwise consult my [contacts](/page/contacts).
