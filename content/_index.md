Welcome to my blog, I am Giulio Pierantoni and I write about hacking and offensive security.

This site mostly exists for me to have a place to save my work and share it with others, I love taking really close looks at the topics I cover so expect wordy posts. 

The main topics will be Windows and Active Directory security, network pentesting in general, and occasionally ROM hacking for Gameboy Pok√©mon games, because why not.
